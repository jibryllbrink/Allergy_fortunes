# Fortune Teller Project Spec

Fortune teller project was a simple use of making a form using html.

## About My Idea/Reflection

My idea was to create a form collecting data about allergies. I learned a lot about different list elements such as inputs & drop-downs, and tried to make it reflect a real Allergy Form that could be used.

## Usage

This form can be copied printed and used for anyone who pleases.
