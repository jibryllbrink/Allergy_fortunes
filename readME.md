## Fortune Form Questions

An simple html form about allergies

When your press submit it goes to the url file:///allergies-submit

Keys unknown but it would come after the ? in the url.

Values unknown but they would come after the = sign.

Pass multiple values through the URL query string for a single key by seperating them with a "&".

## Weather API Questions

a weather app that tells you the weather in any given city

Describe the data contained in the API response. What can we discern about the weather in the specified city?
 -By looking at the information, we can discern information about the city weather including long./lat. coordinates, weather description, high and low temps, pressure, humidity, visibility, wind (speed/degrees), clouds, and the time of sunrise/ sunset.
How would we obtain the temperature in the specified city? Describe using Python dictionary syntax. (HINT: Assume that the JSON response is stored in a variable called json_response.)

- json_response["main"]["temp"]
